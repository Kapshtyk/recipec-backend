# Recipes Backend

## Project description

This is my educational project - REST API for soup recipe application (Broth'er). At the moment I've fully implemented the auth and users modules, including unit testing of controllers and services, and e2e testing of the user creation pipeline. The recipes and ingredients modules are also in place, but need some polishing and testing.

## Technologies used

- MongoDB
- Jest
- Typescript
